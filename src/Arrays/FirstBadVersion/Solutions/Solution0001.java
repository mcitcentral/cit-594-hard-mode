/**
 * First Bad Version | Leetcode #0278 | Easy
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/
 * 
 * You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.
 * Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.
 * You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which returns whether verssion is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.
 * You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

/**
 * Solution Notes by @wilsonplau - A variation of BinarySearch that requires
 * finding an edge instead of a values - Search always checks lower value for
 * edge, so we need to handle the case when it is element 1 - Otherwise, this is
 * quite similar to normal binary search
